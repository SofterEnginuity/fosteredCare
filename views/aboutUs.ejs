                    What is Fostered Care?
                    Fostered Care is a free platform that connects foster families with licensed respite providers. It helps foster families find qualified caregivers who can provide temporary care for children in need, giving them a well-deserved break.

                <p>Fostered Care is intended for two groups: foster families who need respite care and licensed respite providers who offer services. Foster families can use the platform to find qualified caregivers who are ready to step in and assist with temporary care. Licensed providers can sign up to offer their services and connect with families in need of care. To ensure security and reliability, both foster families and respite providers must be registered with the Department of Human Services before using the platform.</p>

                    3.Secure Messaging: Our in-app messaging system keeps your communication secure and confidential. Foster families and providers can discuss care details without compromising privacy.
                    4.Ongoing Monitoring: We continually monitor the platform to ensure that all interactions and activities adhere to safety standards.</p>

Families can browse, connect, and schedule care with licensed providers without paying any registration or subscription fees. The goal is to make it as easy and cost-effective as possible for families to find the support they need, while giving providers a way to share their expertise with those who need it most.</p>
                <h3 id="h3">How do I get started?</h3>
